    <h1>Skills for Cooking</h1>
    <p>Here are some skills that you should know before cooking.</p>
    <h2>Cutting foods.</h2>
    <p>You can cut like a professional chef using a knife to slice herbs, dice onions or cut meat.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The handle grip where your thumb and forefinger are on the handle of the knife.
        </li>
        <li>
            The blade grip where the thumb and forefinger hold the top of the blade of the knife.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cover the pot timely.</h2>
    <p> The use of a lid seems to depend on what is being cooked, and how long it is being cooked.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you're steaming green vegetables, and they will be steamed for more than five minutes, then you should not use the lid.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you're boiling water to cook pasta, which requires a large amount of water, a lid is good to use at first.
        </li>
    </ul>
