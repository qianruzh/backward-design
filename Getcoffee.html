    <h1>How to use coffee machine</h1>
    <p>Pulling a great shot of espresso requires skills and the right equipment. We’ll guide you through the whole espresso-making process and get you a basic understanding.</p>
    <h2>Step1: Turn On And Preheat Your Espresso Maker</h2>
    <p>In order to get the best out of your espresso maker, you’ll need to ensure that the entire machine is preheated. This can take up to 25 minutes for some machines, so get your machine warming up in advance!</p>

    <h2>Step2: Measure And Grind Your Beans</h2>
    <p>Place your portafilter on your scale and tare the scale out, then fill your portafilter with around 20 grams of ground coffee. It is a good idea to write down how much you used so that you can remain consistent during the dialing in phase.</p>

    <h2>Step3: Tamp Your Grounds So The Bed Is Flat And Even</h2>
    <p>You’ll want your beans roughly evenly distributed before tamping. This can be accomplished by lightly tapping the side of the portafilter with your hand, or even by leveling the espresso grounds off with the side of your finger as we showed you above.</p>
    <p>The key to tamping well is to press down straight – you do not want to have an uneven puck. You’ll want to use a fair bit of pressure her, although the age-old wisdom of 30lbs of pressure is probably overkill. A good rule to follow is tamp until the grounds stop settling, always ensuring that you have a level top. Perfect Daily Grind explained why doing so is important. </p>

    <h2>Step4: Pull Your First Shot</h2>
    <p>While you pull this shot, time how long it takes to hit 2 ounces (the typical size of a double shot). Ideally, you’ll end up between 20 and 30 seconds per pull.</p>

    <h2>Step5: Steam Your Milk</h2>
    <p>Using your machines steam wand – Start out with cold milk poured into your stainless steel milk pitcher. Turn on your steamer wand briefly to eliminate any condensation that may have accumulated in the wand.</p>
    <p>Next, put the steamer wand tip below the surface of the milk. Turn on your steamer and froth the milk until it reaches your desired consistency. Be sure to keep the steamer wand just below the surface during this process.</p>
    <p>Once you’ve reached the frothiness you want, plunge the tip to the bottom of your milk vessel and continue steaming until you reach your desired temperature. Wipe your wand down and give it a brief purge to keep things sanitary. You can check out our more thorough milk steaming guide right here.</p>
