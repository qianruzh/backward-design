    <h1>Pick up a recipe</h1>
    <p>Here are some recipies for different coffee.</p>
    <h2>Americano.</h2>
    <p>Americano is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added.</p>
    <p>You can make an Americano by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pull 2 espresso shots from the Breville Barista Expresso Espresso Maker with freshly ground beans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour over a cup of ice filled to the rim.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chilled filtered water and enjoy.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Latte.</h2>
    <p>Latte is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. There are variants such as the chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used.</p>
    <p>You can make an Latte by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fill a cup with cold milk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Brew one shot of espresso in an espresso machine like the Nespresso Vertuoline Evoluo Deluxe, pour into the cup, and stir.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add ice and serve.
        </li>
    </ul>
