    <h1>Put your ingredients together.</h1>
    <p>Here are some tips if you want to make your coffee looks good.</p>
    <h2>Make a latte art</h2>
    <p>Latte art is a method of preparing coffee created by pouring microfoam into a shot of espresso and resulting in a pattern or design on the surface of the latte.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Begin with the cup tilted slightly away from you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour steamed milk into the center of the cup.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drop the pitcher closer to the cup; speed up your pour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wiggle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Untilt the cup, slow down, raise the pitcher a half an inch, and finish the rosetta.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Layered dirty coffee</h2>
    <p>Dirty coffee is a doubleshot poured directly onto cold milk. When served fresh, it has a very interesting palate: the espresso on the surface and cold milk at the bottom making it hot and cold at the same time</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Use refrigerated ice bok.
        </li>
        <li>
            Refrigerate to cool the cup completely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put 8 points full ice bok milk in the iced glass.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the cup directly under the coffee machine to extract the coffee. Place the cup as close to the brewing head as possible (you may also use a spoon) to reduce the impact of the coffee liquid on the milk liquid surface when the coffee liquid drops.
        </li>
    </ol>
