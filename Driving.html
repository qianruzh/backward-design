    <h1>Skills for Driving</h1>
    <p>Here are some skills that you should know before driving a car.</p>
    <h2>Know the driving rules in your location.</h2>
    <p>Before you get a permit, it's important to be aware of the rules of driving and the basic safety precautions you should take as a responsible driver. It's much more advisable to learn the rules before you get behind the wheel so you don't wing it and make mistakes as you go along. Here's how:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Read the driver's handbook provided by the DMV or your local department that regulates driving and automobiles. This may be found online on the official government website. If you do not learn the rules, you won't be able to get your permit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some basic rules and common-sense safety precautions that everyone should know include: stopping for pedestrians, obeying traffic signs, staying within the speed limit, handling emergencies, and wearing your seatbelt.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Place your car into gear.</h2>
    <p>Since you are learning on an automatic, this will either be (D) Drive or (R) Reverse, depending on how you are parked.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you're driving forward, you should put your car in Drive.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you're driving backward, in order to back out of a driveway or a parking spot, your car should be in Reverse.
        </li>
        <li>
            If reversing, first check your rearview mirror and then place your hand on the passenger seat as you turn your head to the right to look behind you.
        </li>
    </ul>
